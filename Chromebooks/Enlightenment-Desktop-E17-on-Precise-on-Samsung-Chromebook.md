Have to share what a great experience I am having with e17. It is fast and low footprint. And lives up to the billing of being beautiful. Hand in hand with Crouton, it makes running Precise in a chroot a magical experience. In case you're wondering which desktop target to experiment with, I recommend it without reservation. And I had never used it before in several years of using various distros.

It's a short learning curve and well worth your time and energy.

Forgot to mention that I added the e17 target on top of xfce4 and they play nicely in the same chroot.
