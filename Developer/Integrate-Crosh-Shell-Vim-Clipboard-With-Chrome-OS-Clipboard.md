If you want to integrate crouton with the Chrome OS system clipboard you have two choices:

# Crouton clipboard
This is chiefly made for vim users, but I'm sure you could port it to emacs or whatever you want to do with it.

[Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/crouton-clipboard/jipofmbanedhjnpooojdeeddanhfljif)

# crosh-clip

Binary releases and source code are available here [croshclip](https://github.com/acornejo/croshclip). It relies on the 
the same crouton integration [extension](https://github.com/acornejo/croshclip) used by xiwi.
