# Using i3 in crouton 

1. Create a chroot with X11:  
`$ sudo sh ~/Downloads/crouton -r trusty -t x11 `
2. Enter the chroot:  
`$ sudo enter-chroot -n trusty`
3. Install i3:  
`$ sudo apt-get install i3`
4. Add `exec i3` to ~/.xinitrc:  
`$ echo "exec i3" > ~/.xinitrc`
5. Launch i3 directly from the crosh shell:  
`$ sudo enter-chroot xinit`
6. Create an alias for starting in i3:  
add `alias starti3='sudo enter-chroot -n trusty xinit'` to your `/home/chronos/user/.bashrc` (chromeos)

### Helpful configurations

* To change themes easily without installing too many other packages try: `sudo apt-get install lxappearance`
* For a proper Delete key, use `bindsym $mod+BackSpace exec xdotool key Delete` in your i3 config

# Alternatively: Crouton + XFCE + i3

Install crouton with XFCE and log in into XFCE with `sudo startxfce4`. Download i3: `$ sudo apt-get install i3`

Go to 'Session and Startup > Application Autostart' settings and '+ Add' a new command with the following field values:

- Name: i3
- Description: i3
- Command: /usr/bin/i3

Go to 'Session and Startup > Session', select the 'xfce-desktop' (amongst other xfce desktop related items -- all I have running is `Xfsettingsd`, `Power Manager`, and `pulseaudio`) and click 'Quit program'. Save session and restart chroot.

i3 should be up and running at this point.


# Run i3 within [[xiwi|crouton in a Chromium OS window (xiwi)]] (running in a chrome window, instead of in xorg etc)

## Install i3
If you haven't installed xiwi (or used it), you can follow the page below to install:

  https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton/wiki/crouton-in-a-Chromium-OS-window-%28xiwi%29
  (Note: To install xiwi target, e.g. sudo sh ~/Downloads/crouton.sh -t xiwi ...)
  
Then make sure we have i3 installed (additionally you may need dmenu installed):
  sudo apt-get install i3 dmenu
  (note: actually i3 is already installed with the default xiwi target, but in case not, you can use the command above, follow the instructions above to install. )

## There are 2 methods to run i3 under xiwi:
  1. Run i3 after entering in a crouton prompt:
```
      $ sudo enter-chroot
      $ XMETHOD=xiwi xinit /usr/bin/i3
      (i3 would be happily running within xiwi under crouton)
```
Or, one liner (thanks [@dragon788](https://github.com/dragon788)): 
```
sudo  sh -e "/usr/local/bin/enter-chroot" "$@" exec env XMETHOD=xiwi  xinit /usr/bin/i3
```

  2. Alternatively, create the following script to start i3 (modified based on startxfce4 etc), for which I named as starti3:
    ` 
>       #!/bin/sh -e
>       set -e
>       APPLICATION="${0##*/}"
>       
>       USAGE="$APPLICATION [options]
>       
>       Wraps enter-chroot to start a i3 session.
>       By default, it will log into the primary user on the first chroot found.
>       
>       Options are directly passed to enter-chroot; run enter-chroot to list them."
>       
>       exec sh -e "/usr/local/bin/enter-chroot" "$@" exec xinit /usr/bin/i3
>     `

## Issues with running i3 under xiwi:
  - Currently, mod+1, 2, 3 ... doesn't work to switch workspace. For which I suspect chromebook system intercepts these keys as they are default shortcut key on chromebook ... don't know if there's a fix for it yet.
