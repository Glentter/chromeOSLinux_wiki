**NOTE:** this is just a workaround for the udev section of the wiki, udev is confusing.... 

( reference to issue [#4330](https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton/issues/4330) pertaining the issue of needing to use `sudo` when attempting to access/run contents on an external usb drive )

This is gonna be very simple, so follow the steps **closely**

1. Make sure your External Media is mounted with exec as one of the flags/targets ( ``sudo mount -o remount,exec /media/removable/Drive_Name`` ), I would suggest putting it into the .bashrc file in crosh ( the micro editor is suggested for this, as vim can be broken in crosh. note micro will need to be sudoed on with the following: ``sudo ./micro``, or move it into your bin, to prevent such an annoyance )
2. login to root on your chroot
3. Open `/etc/rc.local`
4. append the following lines per External Device you wish to make accessible: ``sudo chown -R CHROOT_USERNAME:root /media/removable/Drive_Name``

Edit: You do not need sudo in the rc.local file, it's already running as root

5. At the end of the file, be sure that the line ``exit 0`` is still existing, if it is not, add it now.
6. Save and exit the file
7. restart chroot
8. enjoy

If the steps above do not work for you, Ask around, maybe an update has occured, and no one got to updating this page yetThe below (which I wrote while still learning about crouton) is way overblown. All in the world you need to do is change your power settings so the Chromebook doesn't sleep when it's inactive & the power's turned on. Be sure this setting's in place before creating or updating a chroot. If you wish the screen to turn off, that's fine. Just don't let it sleep. Always be sure the unit is plugged in before creating or updating a chroot.


***


UPDATE - Since going back to storing my chroot on the built-in SSD, I've experienced almost no stability issues. Worse case is logging out of my chroot, then logging back in too quickly, requiring me to unmount the chroot:

`sudo unmount-chroot xenial -y -f` or whatever your chroot name is.

A possible cause of crashes is switching back and forth between your chroot and ChomeOS, especially when switching to your chroot while a screensaver is running, which can result in a black screen. To get back to ChromeOS, try these steps:

1. Press Shift-Ctrl-Alt-F1 (left arrow)
2. Press Ctrl-Alt-F2 (right arrow)
3. Press Ctrl-Alt-F1 (left arrow)

Now you should be back at ChromeOS.

EDIT - Here is another take on handling your chroots power situation (see below for original post):

Before creating or updating your chroot, go over the VT2 (Ctrl-Alt-F2), login in as chronos, then type

`sudo initctl stop powerd`

and press Enter. This will absolutely prevent your Chromebook from going to sleep. In this case, you can still configure your Chromebook to "sleep when inactive" if you wish to conserve power. Note that after the above command, the brightness controls will no longer work. After your install or update is complete, type

`sudo initctl start powerd`

and press Enter. Finally, in your chroot, make sure you include the following line in your /etc/rc.local:

`croutonpowerd -i &`

All entries in /etc/rc.local must end with the space ampersand in order for crouton's prepare script to work properly. Since your chroot does not actually "boot up", the prepare script permits you to activate servers, mount drives, and do other stuff that would be part of the "init" process of a full install.

NOTE: Many crouton users have reported having to turn off, disable, or uninstall xscreensaver in order to prevent chroot crashes. All I can suggest is, do a burn in test: Setup your chroot, and let it run all night/day with/without the screensaver and see what happens. For safety's sake, mount your chroot in the "normal" place, i.e., your Chromebook's SSD card, prior to moving it to an external location.

Thanks, James

My Acer Chromebook 11 C740 runs Crouton quite well. However, if I'm storing the chroot on an SD card, and the Chromebook goes to sleep, if forgets where my SD card is located. Then, I can't eject it from File Manager or the command line, and have to power down and reboot. Then I have to run a command like,

`sudo fsck /dev/sdb`

and wait for it to clean up the file system: if it even can, that is.

***
UPDATE: After losing data for the umpteenth time with a chroot mounted on an SD card, I have gone back to locating my chroots on the Chromebook's SSD. Then I use an SD card or external USB drive to hold my user data.
***

Turn off Screen Lock (under People) and then disable sleep mode (under Device, Power). Do not even allow the screen to turn off if inactive. You can always lock your Chromebook manually if you need to.

Hope this saves you hours of frustration from losing data.

Having said all this, in all honesty, your chroot will likely tend to crash from time to time, especially if you have only 2 GB RAM and a 16 GB SSD, as does my C740, and more especially, if the chroot is stored on an external MicroSD card.

Crouton is the cleverest script I have ever seen for running Linux in a chroot jail. However, if you wish for greater stability, a full Linux install may be the best way to go.

Thanks ~James# Backups

Use `sudo edit-chroot -b nameofchroot` (in a crosh terminal shell) to back up your chroot, and `sudo edit-chroot -r nameofchroot` to restore it. if `edit-chroot not found`, use `sudo crouton -f nameofchroot.tar.gz` to restore it.  edit-chroot will warn you if you're clobbering a chroot by restoring, in which case you need to run `sudo edit-chroot -rr nameofchroot` (two r's to confirm that you want to clobber it). 

Be aware that the backup file is automatically placed into your Downloads folder. If you are in guest mode there will not be enough space there. Instead, be sure to log in before you run a backup so you can use your hard drive space.

Once the backup of your chroot has completed, it is placed in your ~/Downloads folder by default. It is important to immediately move not only your chroot backup file, but all files in your ~/Downloads folder that are not backed up to either removable storage such as USB drives, and/or cloud storage. The reason why it is so important to move your chroot, and the contents of the ~/Downloads folder is that in some cases your ~/Downloads folder may not retain all of your files, and may in extreme cases be subject to overwriting, like a system /tmp directory. Also, in the event that you need to perform a Powerwash on the system, the contents of your ~/Downloads directory will not be recoverable.

Keep in mind that in most cases, your ~/Downloads directory is accessible from your chroot's /home/username/Downloads directory, in addition and is also likely shared with Chromium OS's Downloads folder. So it is very likely while using your chroot, or Chromium OS, that you may have some important user content in this directory, and it is NOT backed up during a regular chroot backup. Don't forget to back this special shared directory separately.

After backing up your chroot, save the compressed tar file of the chroot to a safe off-line USB device, network storage, or cloud storage, as well as the contents of your ~/Downloads folder. You may wish to make a USB restore image file as well, so if you need to revert to the exact system, chroot, and ~/Downloads data state of your backup, you will be able to in the future.

In the likely event that you run out of drive space on your Chromebook, you can change the source and destination tarball using -f. Use `sudo edit-chroot -f /path/to/folder -b nameofchroot` and then reconcile and restore your backed up ~/Downloads folder.

If you get an error that the -b option is not available in edit-chroot, it means you need to download the latest version of crouton and use it to update your chroot. The crouton update flag is -u. For example `sudo sh -e crouton -r raring -t xfce -u` could be used to update an existing chroot based on the Raring Release and xfce Target. The update includes a newer version of edit-chroot which support the -b and -r options.

In the event that you want to restore a backup to a stock chromebook (with developer mode enabled) you can use the crouton installer with the -f option specifying the backup's tarball, e.g., `sudo sh -e crouton -r raring -t xfce -f /media/removable/SD\ Card/backup/raring-20130617-1234.tar.gz`

## Large Backups are Split

If your chroot is over 4GB in size, it may be automatically split depending on filesystem, as described in [#3513]( https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton/issues/3513#issuecomment-344150514) and in the `edit-chroot` command docs:

```
-s SPLIT    Force a backup archive to be split into SPLIT-sized chunks.
            SPLIT is specified in megabytes (1048576 bytes), and cannot be
            smaller than 10.
            FAT32 filesystems are split by default to fit within 4GB.
```

You don't have to do anything special to restore these backups, but you need to make sure you have all parts of the file together.As an alternative to the general method, described in the README, you can download `crouton` directly using shell (Ctrl+Alt+T, type `shell` and hit enter) with the following commands:

- Create required target dir and don't print an error if /usr/local/bin/ directory already exists; it's created automatically if you ran `dev_install` for experimenting with ChromeOS development, otherwise you may create it manually:

`sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/bin`

- download the crouton release & & :

`sudo curl -L -s -o /usr/local/bin/crouton https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dnschneid/crouton/master/installer/crouton`

- set the executable permissions for it 

`sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/crouton`

- run it once to show help and prove it works

`sudo crouton`

- copy and paste the whole block below to run all these commands automatically together

```
sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/bin && \
sudo curl -L -s -o /usr/local/bin/crouton https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dnschneid/crouton/master/installer/crouton && \
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/crouton && \
sudo crouton
```# CLI Development Environment
This doc is about how to set up a development environment using a chrome app and a compiler inside crouton. This could be changed to use any editor on chromeos that allows external extension messaging on hotkeys or buttons, as well as any kind of compiler or interpreter on the crouton side. For this example, we will be using [Caret](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/caret/fljalecfjciodhpcledpamjachpmelml) as the editor/IDE and gcc as the compiler inside crouton.

You will need python3 on your crouton instance in order to do this.

The program is made out of 3 parts:
* A trigger inside Caret
* An extension in chrome that does a web call
* A python script in crouton that receives a web call and uses the address in the call to build a file

## Caret Extension
This will allow Caret to tell our extension when an event has happened, and tells our extension what file we are working on.

### External Command
In caret, go to Settings > External Commands.
We will add a new external command.
We name our external command "build". We will use this to trigger it later.
The ID will be the ID from the extension we will create, which can be viewed in the chrome extensions panel.
The message is just information about what this command is, so that we can theoretically distinguish between different calls. Not necessarily needed in this example.
sendEditorContext tells caret to also send the current file location and selected text to our extension, which we want as we want to just build the file we currently have open.
```
{
  "build": {
    "id": "gbkkikigjbfljcghfjngemlfgpjbfhjk",
    "message": {
      "data": "build"
    },
    "sendEditorContext": true
  }
}
```

### Keyboard
We will also add a hotkey to trigger our command inside Caret. You may chose to do this using a menu or another method inside Caret if you like.
At the end of the file, add a command to trigger our build api call
We will trigger off Control+B, you may chose any hotkey that does not conflict with one already existing.

```
...
  //dev mode
  "Ctrl-.": { "command": "app:show-prompt" },
  
  //Build
  "Ctrl-B": { "command": "api:execute", "argument": "build"}
}
```
You can see that our api:execute argument is build, which is the name of our external command above.


## Chrome Extension
Create a new folder in your Downloads folder, mine is called Auto GCC.
In it, create two files: main.js, manifest.json

### manifest.json
The manifest file is the file that tells chrome about the extension. For us it is very simple, the only important thing is the background property, where we define that one of our scripts is a background event script. All other properties are misc properties needed to define any chrome extension.
```
{
  "manifest_version": 2,

  "name": "GCC Auto",
  "description": "Extension to Caret to build GCC on crouton",
  "version": "1.0",
  
  "background": {
    "scripts": ["main.js"],
    "persistent": false
  }
}
```

### main.js
This file contains our logic which connects the chrome extension to our webserver running on crouton.
Firstly, it sends a command to Caret telling it to save the current file first.
This code takes the location of the current file from Caret, then makes a new http request on a port (I chose 8008), and sends a request to that address with the file location appended. We could do this many different ways and probably more effiently with websockets but I'm lazy and its only one call so it won't have any performance impact.
```
chrome.runtime.onMessageExternal.addListener(function(message, sender, sendResponse){
  chrome.runtime.sendMessage("fljalecfjciodhpcledpamjachpmelml", {command:"session:save-file"});
  var fileLocation = message.context.path;
  var xhttp = new XMLHttpRequest();
  xhttp.open("GET", "http://localhost:8008/"+fileLocation, true);
  xhttp.send();
});
```

## Crouton python script
This is a script you will run constantly in the background or in a side window while you program in your Caret window.

Create a new script in your downloads folder (or somewhere else if you desire, you can just use Caret to edit the file if its in your downloads.). I called mine gccserver.py

This file basically sets up a webserver running on localhost:8008 and waits for a request. When it recieves a request, if the url is the right type (a C file), then it will do a call to gcc to build that file, then run it in the shell.

I also added a variable called verbose which you can enable to have a more verbose console telling you when the building, etc, is happening.
```
import http.server
import socketserver
from subprocess import *
import os

verbose = True

class AutoGCCServer(http.server.BaseHTTPRequestHandler):
  def do_GET(self):
    fileLoc = os.getenv("HOME") + self.path[2:]
    if(fileLoc[-1] == "c"):
      do_build(fileLoc)
    else:
      print("Error: {} is not a C file".format(fileLoc))
    self.send_response(200)
    self.send_header('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', self.headers.get('origin'))
    self.send_header('Access-Control-Allow-Methods', 'POST, OPTIONS')
    self.end_headers()
    
  def log_message(self, format, *args):
    return


def do_build(fileLoc):
  outputLoc = fileLoc[:-1] + "o"
  if verbose:
    print("Building '{}'".format(fileLoc))
  try:
    check_call(["gcc", fileLoc, "-o", outputLoc])
  except CalledProcessError as e:
    print("Build failed")
    print(e.returncode)
  if verbose:
    print("Executing '{}'".format(outputLoc))
  exited = False
  try:
    check_call([outputLoc])
    print("~Completed without error~")
  except KeyboardInterrupt:
    print("...")
  except CalledProcessError as e:
    print("~Completed with error code {}~".format(e.returncode))


if __name__ == "__main__":
  PORT = 8008
  socketserver.TCPServer.allow_reuse_address = True
  httpd = socketserver.TCPServer(("", PORT), AutoGCCServer)
  try:
    httpd.serve_forever()
  except KeyboardInterrupt:
    pass
  except:
    print("Error Occured.")
  httpd.shutdown()
  print("\nServer stopped")
```

## Putting it all together
We now need to set everything up.

To install the extension, go to Extensions, enable Developer mode, and click Load unpacked extension. Select the extension folder we created and click open.
In a shell window, run the server file with python3 in crouton.

Now, create a C file, write some test code and press your button combination (Ctrl+B).
You should see the shell compile and run your program in the background!This doc is about how to set up a customizable terminal window that doesn't have to run inside a Chrome tab. It is a guide using several Chrome extensions in tandem to create an authentic terminal app running inside Chrome OS. It assumes that you have a CLI installation of Crouton, and you wish to run it alongside the Chrome browser. There are many bits and pieces, but I found a very useful setup for my CLI Crouton chroot that I thought worth sharing with others. It serves as a good complement to the doc [CLI Development Environment](https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton/wiki/CLI-Development-Environment), which focuses on implementing [Caret](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/caret/fljalecfjciodhpcledpamjachpmelml) as a text editor.

![Crouton CLI running in Terminal window](https://github.com/brentirwin/images/blob/master/image.png?raw=true)

## Secure Shell Extension

The [Secure Shell Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/secure-shell-extension/iodihamcpbpeioajjeobimgagajmlibd) claims to be a terminal emulator and SSH client for Chrome OS, but it is nowhere near as functional as your Crouton. This extension is a prerequisite for the Crosh Window Extension, and it allows you to customize your terminal window as well.

When you install this extension, right-click on its icon and select Options. This is where you can customize the look of your terminal. For the setup used in the image, I added "Droid Sans Mono Dotted" as the first item in the "font-family" line, and pasted the following in "color-pallette-overrides" to give it a [Solarized Dark](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) color theme:

```
[
  "#073642",
  "#dc322f",
  "#859900",
  "#b58900",
  "#268bd2",
  "#d33682",
  "#2aa198",
  "#eee8d5",
  "#002b36",
  "#cb4b16",
  "#586e75",
  "#657b83",
  "#839496",
  "#6c71c4",
  "#93a1a1",
  "#fdf6e3"
]
```

Maks sure "environment" contains the line `"TERM": "xterm-256color"`. I found the settings "copy-on-select" and "mouse-right-click-paste" to be very useful. 

Note that the alpha slider on "background-color" does not appear to work with Crosh Window, and it should be kept at 100%, or the background color will default to black. Also note that changing the "font-size" here will not change the integrity of your Crosh Window later, as it defaults to an 80x24 window regardless of font size.

## Crosh Window Extension

The next extension to install is the [Crosh Window Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/crosh-window/nhbmpbdladcchdhkemlojfjdknjadhmh). This is the application to pin to your shelf for easy access. Opening this applicaiton will launch Crosh in an isolated terminal window, outside of your Chrome tabs, using the settings you chose in Secure Shell Options. To open the terminal without moving your hands from the keyboard, type `ðŸ” crosh [Enter]`. (This will work after opening Crosh Window more often than Crosh, and Google will predict Crosh Window as the top choice.)

Then as always to get into it, type
```
crosh> shell
chronos@localhost / $ sudo startcli
```
to enter your Crouton chroot.

## Fixing the color scheme

The color scheme you chose probably will not be working right off the bat, so you have to make sure your Bash profile is using xterm. Add the following line anywhere in your `~/.bashrc` file.
```
export TERM=xterm-256color
```
Save the file and refresh the Bash profile (`$ source ~/.bashrc`). All of the color issues that were present (and they were even worse in tmux) are now fixed, and you're ready to go!

## Root directory

The default directory you'll find yourself in the root directory which only contains a single directory, Downloads. It can be tempting to do your work here in the root directory, but anything you do outside of that Downloads folder will not be accessible in Chrome OS. If you're like me, your Downloads folder is a horrible mess, and you don't want to navigate through it in the command line either. Using symbolic links, you can create easy-to-access directories that live in your Downloads folder, but you don't have to fool with it to find them.

In my case, I have 2 directories: dev, school, and txt for development projects, schoolwork, and text files I keep. First, create the directory inside of downloads, either in the Chrome OS file navigator or using `$ mkdir ~/Downloads/dev`. Then create a symbolic link:
```
$ ln -s ~/Downloads/dev ~/dev
```

Now when you boot up your new terminal window, you will be able to navigate directly to your dev directory without worrying about the messy Downloads folder. But if you need to access the files in Chrome OS, say, to email them to someone else, simply find the dev folder located nicely inside of Downloads! Repeat as necessary.

## Use

I've found this setup to be almost all I need for most school projects and fully capable for web development. If you're comfortable using Vim, you're ready to go. If you'd like a more traditional text editor, check out [this other page in the wiki](https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton/wiki/CLI-Development-Environment). This chroot is fully capable of running Node.js or Rails, and pointing your Chrome browser to localhost:<PORT> will work as expected.

In my experience, giving myself a fully-functional Ubuntu terminal using this setup has turned my Chromebook from a cheap web browsing machine into a lightweight, capable, web and CLI development machine.

## Closing

When closing the Crosh Window, be sure to do it properly. Type `exit` to exit the Crouton chroot, `exit` to exit the shell, and `exit` to exit Crosh. This final exit will close the window. Closing the window via the X in the title bar may cause processes to continue running in the background that won't be accessible via `ps` in another window. Be sure to also use multiple `exit`s to close the window.
You can run any command as root before or instead of an interactive chroot session.

```
sudo sh ./enter-chroot -l -x passwd <username>
```Most issues can be fixed by downloading a fresh installer, and updating your chroot:

 1. Remove any existing installer from your `Downloads` folder.
 2. Fetch a fresh installer: [https://goo.gl/fd3zc](https://goo.gl/fd3zc)
 3. Open a crosh shell (Ctrl-Alt-T, then type `shell`)
 4. Prep the installer with: `sudo install -Dt /usr/local/bin -m 755 ~/Downloads/crouton` 
 5. Figure out the name of your chroot(s). If you do not know, `sudo edit-chroot -a` (on recent enough crouton), or `sudo ls /usr/local/chroots` will provide you with a list of chroot names.
 6. Run an update: `sudo crouton -n chrootname -u`, where `chrootname` is the name of your chroot, 
make sure there are no errors.
 7. Reboot: shutdown completely and restart.
 8. Try starting your chroot again.

If the problem still occurs:
 - Check [existing issues](https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue) if your problem has already been reported. If you are not 100% sure this is the same issue, open a new one, it's easier for the devs to mark an issue as duplicate than keeping track of 2 issues under the same thread.
 - Open a new issue. Be sure to include: 
   - The exact command you run
   - At least the last 20 lines of output
   - Any error in the update process above
   - The output of `sudo enter-chroot -n chrootname croutonversion`, where `chrootname` is the name of your chroot (see above).[Is there a crouton forum? #1552](https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton/issues/1552)

* **Unmount** a chroot: ``sudo unmount-chroot chrootname`` (run ``unmount-chroot`` for more info). Using the -f switch can be helpful for freeing up orphaned processes from 'xiwi -T' apps that mounted in the background using the 'enter-chroot -b' background exec.
* **Launch a single app in a Window** in the background<sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup>: ``sudo startxiwi -b -n chrootname app_name`` (e.g., ``xterm``)
* **Launch a single app in a Tab**: ``sudo startxiwi -n chrootname -T app_name`` (e.g., ``-T xterm``) 

_Notes_
* Think of some notations as variables in an equation. For example, substitute the name of your chroot for ``chrootname`` or ``name_of_evilchroot``. 
* Similarly, ``source`` is the name of the source chroot that you want to change, and ``destination`` is the new name of a chroot. 
* Use the ``-f`` switch to define the path. The user download directory is ``~/Downloads`` and an external drive begins ``/media/removable/``. To check your path, use ``cd`` and ``ls`` from within the shell. For example, enter ``cd /media/removable/`` and then ``ls`` to check. 
* To run a chroot in a window you need the [browser integration extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/crouton-integration/gcpneefbbnfalgjniomfjknbcgkbijom) and you must install ``-t xiwi``. To run the old fashioned way, you need  ``-t xorg``. To switch between the two, see above. 
* Once you mount a chroot (see above) you can update and install packages. Stay away from the Ubuntu Software manager, and use the command line. See Ubuntu's [AptGet/Howto](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AptGet/Howto). 

<a name="myfootnote1">1</a>: When using the 'xiwi-app', if the Linux app that is being launched forks (to the background) - use the 'xiwi' ``-f`` option to keep xiwi running until all windows are closed. For more info, please see [this page](https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton/wiki/crouton-in-a-Chromium-OS-window-%28xiwi%29) in the Wiki.

To see the list of network adapters:

After my toying with my VPN settings, I had 4 extra tun devices, and it didn't seem as if chromeos has a cleanup script.

To delete the tunX devices, repeat for as many tun[?]:

%  sudo ip tuntap del dev tun1 mode tun

If you accidentally delete tun0, connecting with chromeos VPN will restore it.This project may not be worth your time, but here goes. Open up xscreensaver, and just go down the list. Click Preview on each one. Some screensavers will crash your chroot almost instantly, and you will have to get back to ChromeOS. Try this:

1. Shift-Ctrl-Alt-F1 (left arrow)
2. Ctrl-Alt-F2 (right arrow)
3. Ctrl-Alt-F1 (left arrow)

Now restart your chroot, if possible. If not, you may have to reboot. Anyhow, go back into your xscreensaver and uncheck the activation box for the "bad" hack.

Generally, make sure no box is checked for any screensaver hack which is not installed. If the item fails to show a preview, uncheck it. VidWhacker is a good example. I've had success with installing xscreensaver-data-extra, then going down the entire list, making sure everything is congruent.

It may be easier to choose just a single screensaver, or blank screen, or disable xscreensaver, or uninstall it.

After getting Dropbox to compile and run, it complains that it's missing the proprietary daemon, which is impossible to download anywhere for the ARM (new Samsung $249 chromebook). Monitor the feature request [here](https://forums.dropbox.com/topic.php?id=105304). [ This section needs update.]

For x86 and in case the daemon is released
===

Use apt-get if you can:

`sudo apt-get install nautilus-dropbox`

If not, this is a work in progress to help compile dropbox by source. Note the missing packages may differ for your distribution. This is for the default XFCE.

`sudo apt-get install libnautilus-extension-dev python-gtk2 python-docutils`

Download the source and follow instructions at https://www.dropbox.com/install2

`./configure; make`

`sudo make install`

`./dropbox start -i`
# Install (Powerline) fonts in Chrome OS in dev mode

Suppose you want to install some extra fonts (eg [Powerline fonts](https://github.com/powerline/fonts)) to spice up your Crosh Window (eg for [Zsh + agnoster](https://github.com/agnoster/agnoster-zsh-theme)). You might be surprised that after following a tutorial (even those specific to Chrome OS) that places the fonts in your home directory  `fc-cache -vf` does not pick up your new fonts despite the existence of `/etc/fonts/conf.d/50-user.conf` (and even if you manually specify the directory, you will still run into problems with the powerline symbols).
 
The reason is that [the Chrome OS devs have patched the fontconfig to disable loading files from the home directory](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#!msg/chromium-os-dev/SOD7a16iZ7U/mAC1c63MVEwJ).

So how can you install fonts? The solution is to install to `/usr/local/share/fonts`. This location is not in the default fontconfig config so you need to add

```
<dir>/usr/local/share/fonts</dir>
```
to `/etc/fonts/local.conf`

If it complains about being readonly you should remount the partition in rw mode: https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton/issues/582#issuecomment-32581668

Unfortunately `/etc/fonts/local.conf` will be reset on update, so alternatives are very welcome!# Introduction

There are tips for using crouton floating all around the interwebs. This wiki is for collecting them in one space. Anything core to the usage of crouton will probably be moved into the [README](https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton/blob/master/README.md), but device-, environment-, and application- specific usage tips can find a [home](https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton/wiki) here.

## Contributing

Feel free to add your tips and tricks to the wiki.  Do test any commands and scripts you post before submitting them, and try to clean up your instructions.  Don't be surprised or offended when the crouton author(s) and other upstanding community members tweak your tips to make the style consistent, or to work in more general situations.  All tips should be placed in sub-pages, linked in the appropriate category.  It's better to make a separate page for your trick than to have a long page of disparate and unorganized tips, but if you have a bunch of one-liner hints that fit into a coherent group, go ahead and combine them into one page.

## 1. Enter Developer Mode

Hold Power+ESC+Refresh, then let go of the power, when the OS verification warning screen appears enter  Ctrl-D

OR go to Settings >> About --- OS >> Detailed Build info >> Change Channel

## 2. Setup Crouton

Follow the instructions here to download the latest version of https://goo.gl/fd3zc.

Open a chrome terminal tab and then open a shell

    shell

Figure out what version of linux you want to run here https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton

Install the crouton extension in chromeos from here https://goo.gl/OVQOEt

## 3. Setup a chroot
Install Crouton using this command

    sudo install -Dt /usr/local/bin -m 755 ~/Downloads/crouton

I would reccomend running Ubuntu Unity, Gnome 3 and enlightenment using an Ubuntu Trusty Tahr release.

    sudo crouton -t keyboard,extension,unity -r trusty -n unitytrusty
    sudo crouton -t keyboard,extension,gnome -r trusty -n gnometrusty
    sudo crouton -t keyboard,xiwi,e17 -r trusty -n enlightenment
    
After the instalation is complete you will set up your unix username and password for the chroot in the terminal.

Once the chroot is done installing and you have set up your user you launch your chroot using:

    sudo startunity
    sudo startgnome

    xmodmap -e "keycode 22 shift = BackSpace Delete"
    xmodmap -e "keycode 133 = Caps_Lock"
    
    
## * Optional - Install Non Free Software that makes things easier and better looking

    sudo apt-get install ttf-mscorefonts-installer

    sudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras
    
    
## Issues

+   The keyboard command used when installing the chroot don't do anything
+   The chrome extension with chroot chrome window functionality is not working
### Note: For this guide I'll be focusing on ARM Chromebooks and assuming the latest version is jdk1.7.0_60, you may have to update the commands in this guide to match the current version number for the JDK you download. These instructions are based on the intel instructions found on [wikihow](http://www.wikihow.com/Install-Oracle-Java-on-Ubuntu-Linux).

## Downloading Oracle Java
Download the latest version of Oracle JDK: [https://jdk7.java.net/download.html](https://jdk7.java.net/download.html)

You must make sure you download the correct version for your computer's processor. Users with ARM Chromebooks must use the Linux ARMv6/7 HardFP version.

## Extracting
Note: The paths mentioned can be changed depending on the distro or how you've structured your file system. I'll be using the defaults for Ubuntu 12.04 and 13.10.

From your download directory:

```
tar -xvzf jdk-7u60.tar.gz
sudo mv jdk1.7.0_60 /usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.7.0_60
```

## Updating System Settings

The following steps are required to get get your system to point to Oracle Java when running Java applications and compiling.

1. Update /etc/profile using a text editor (ie: nano, gedit, emacs, vi, kate)

Add the following lines to the bottom of /etc/profile (or update any lines if a previous version of Oracle Java was installed):

```
JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.7.0_60
PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin:$JAVA_HOME/bin
JRE_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.7.0_60/jre
PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin:$JRE_HOME/bin
export JAVA_HOME
export JRE_HOME
export PATH
```

Note: after editing /etc/profile. type the following to apply changes:

`. /etc/profile`

Typing `java -version` should then show your current version of java

2. Update Aternatives

Note: These are the manual commands for updating the java and javac alternatives. These changes are included in the advanced section below and don't need to be followed if you follow the advanced instructions.

The following alternatives must be changed at minimum:
```
sudo update-alternatives --install "/usr/bin/java" "java" "/usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.7.0_60/jre/bin/java" 1;
sudo update-alternatives --set "java" "/usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.7.0_60/jre/bin/java";
sudo update-alternatives --install "/usr/bin/javac" "javac" "/usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.7.0_60/bin/javac" 1;
sudo update-alternatives --set "javac" "/usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.7.0_60/bin/javac";
```

This is all that's required for simple compiling.

# Advanced Steps (for packages that rely on default-java, ie: Eclipse)

Install the package default-jre-headless:

`sudo apt-get install default-jre-headless`

Update default java and update-java-alternatives to point to jdk1.7.0_60 (default is openjdk7)

```
cd /usr/lib/jvm;
sudo rm default-java;
sudo ln -s jdk1.7.0_60 default-java;
```

The next step depends on if jinfo files exist from openjdk installations.
From /usr/lib/jvm:

`ls -al` 

look for files that start with a "." and end with ".jinfo", they should be named after openjdk versions if they exist. You'll have to rename these to something that doesn't end with .jinfo, such as:
 renaming ".java-1.7.0-openjdk-armhf.jinfo" to "jinfo.java-1.7.0-openjdk-armhf".

`sudo mv .java-1.7.0-openjdk-armhf.jinfo jinfo.java-1.7.0-openjdk-armhf`

You'll then need to generate a .jinfo file for Oracle Java 1.7.0_60. You can do this manually based on the one you copied over, just name it to match your jdk version then add ".jinfo", or copy the version below and modify the java version.

Note for ARM: You must remove the bottom line for "plugin" from the .jinfo if you're copying another .jinfo, because the arm version doesn't include a web plugin, or javaws.

## Advanced (Cont.) Now to set the oracle version as the default for all of these.

`sudo update-java-alternatives -s jdk1.7.0_60`

This should set Oracle Java as the default for all java commands and for the java-default package, without these steps openjdk will remain the default java version for certain builds.

## Confirming the changes.

Run the following command, it should show all Java executables and if they're pointing to the correct directory.

`update-alternatives --get-selections | grep java`

## Sysrq

Chrome/Chromium OS enables sysrq functionality on the F10/Volume Up key when the system is put in developer mode.  This behavior is reflected in crouton chroot environments and the Alt+F10/Volume Up key combination will be intercepted and interpreted as Alt+sysrq.

## Chromebook keyboard model

Installing crouton's keyboard target provides an xkb overlay that provides similar functions to bindings found in Chromium OS:

`sudo crouton -t keyboard -u`

In order to make the bindings active you will need to edit `/etc/default/keyboard`.  Change the line that starts with `XKBMODEL` to `XKBMODEL="chromebook"`. Your version of OS may require the keyboard model to be set in a different manner.

Chromium OS key bindings can be inspected by typing Ctrl+Alt+/ (or whatever key is directly next to the right Shift key):
 * All Search+key bindings are supported, with the difference that the top row (function keys) maps to F1->F10 by default. Search+function keys map to actual functions (navigation, brightness, volume, etc.).
 * The other bindings (Ctrl+key, Alt+key, ...) are not supported, and will probably never be, as they may interfere with useful key combinations in some Linux applications.

### non-US layout

Non-US layout can be setup by typing: `setxkbmap -layout de` (replace `de` by your layout). Some layouts also need to specify a variant, e.g. `setxkbmap -layout ch -variant fr`. This command needs to be run every time the chroot X server is started (you may want to put it in your window manager startup script or in an `~/.xiwirc` file).

Non-US layouts are compatible with the Chromebook keyboard model, so you still get Search+key bindings.

NOTE: If you have problems with certain characters, especially ones with umlauts (in Finnish/Swedish keyboards), it might be that you don't have correct locale installed. Usually if you have installed only core or x11 target. To fix this, install UTF-8 capable locale, like: en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8. In Debian this is easy:
  * install locales package: `sudo apt-get install locales`
  * run: `sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales` 

### `Super_L` key

Without the `keyboard` target, the Search key maps to `Super_L`, after installing the target, it becomes the overlay key (`Overlay1_Enable`), that allows you to use Search+key combos.

Some window managers require a `Super_L` key, so you can work around this issue by remapping either `Super_L` or `Overlay1_Enable` to another key.

For example, to use Left Alt as overlay key, and Search key as `Super_L`:
```
xmodmap -e "keycode 133 = Super_L"
xmodmap -e "keycode 64 = Overlay1_Enable"
```
or, to keep the Search key as overlay, but use Left Alt as `Super_L` (the first line is not needed if you have not modified the keyboard map before, as keycode 133 maps to `Overlay1_Enable` by default):
```
xmodmap -e "keycode 133 = Overlay1_Enable" # Not needed on "fresh" keymap
xmodmap -e "keycode 64 = Super_L"
```
You can figure out keycodes for all keys by looking at the output of `xev`. But DO NOT remap keycode 134 (normally mapped to `Super_R`) to `Overlay1_Enable`: it won't work (see issue [#362](https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton/issues/362)).

`xmodmap` modifications are lost when you restart the X server, so you should put these in a script that is sourced at session startup. The easiest is to put these commands in a custom shell script, and add the script to the auto-start list of your DE (e.g., instructions for [XFCE](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/xfce#Custom_Startup_Applications))

Alternatively see [this post](https://github.com/AurelienLourot/crouton-articles/blob/master/crouton-caps-lock.md) to simply make the Search key behave as a normal Caps Lock key.

#### Swap Left Control and Search key

Swapping left control with the Search key requires an extra step, as the modifier table also needs to be modified:
```bash
if type croutonversion &>/dev/null; then
  #If this is a crouton chroot, then swap left ctrl and search keys
  xmodmap -e "keycode 133 = Control_L"
  xmodmap -e "keycode 37 = Overlay1_Enable"
  xmodmap -e "add control = Control_L"
  xmodmap -e "remove control = Overlay1_Enable"
fi
````

This may apply to other keys as well, have a look at the output of `xmodmap` before and after swapping the keys, to see if you need to apply a similar trick in your case.

> If you are using XFCE, write a script to swap the left control key and search key using the snippet above 
> and then add this script to XFCE's Application Autostart. (Look under *Settings Manager* > *Session and 
> Startup* > *Application Autostart*, and then click *Add*. For more information, see 
> https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/xfce#Custom_Startup_Applications)

### Unity/Gnome resets xmodmap customization and keyboard layout

For some reason, Unity (and possibly Gnome) resets the keyboard layout everytime the user switches to Chromium OS and back ([#953](https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton/issues/953)).

As a workaround, you can disable keyboard layout management in Gnome with:
```
gsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.keyboard active false
```

However, this will break the layout switching widget.

### Remove the keyboard model

If you install the keyboard target, but then realise a standard keyboard layout is preferable for your use case, you can remove the target by removing its entry from `/etc/crouton/targets`, then running:

```
sudo apt-mark unhold xkb-data
sudo apt-get -y install --reinstall xkb-data
```

### Outstanding issues

The keyboard layout works well in most situations, but there are a few outstanding issues, that do not have a simple solution:

 - There is no good way to bind shortcuts to "Search+letter" combos. (There is an ugly hack in [#267](https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton/issues/267), but we do not want to ship that by default)
 - We are able to swap Search key with another key (see this page), but NOT Super_R, for some unknown reason. ([#362](https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton/issues/362))
 - Currently, Search+Alt toggles Caps lock. This is the reverse of Chromium OS, which uses Alt+Search. (this is easy to fix, actually)
 - It would be nice to make it possible to configure if F1/F12 or function keys are the default ([#665](https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton/issues/665))
 - Search key alone does not do anything ([#665](https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton/issues/665))
 - Unity (and possibly Gnome) resets the keyboard layout everytime the user switches to Chromium OS and back ([#953](https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton/issues/953)).

## Extra key bindings

xbindkeys is loaded in the chroot X server, to allow commands to be executed when certain key combination is pressed (e.g. Ctrl+Alt+Back/Forward to switch between Chromium OS and the chroot display). `.xbindkeysrc.scm` in the user home directory is also loaded, if it exists, allowing to add custom bindings.

The configuration file is based on Scheme/Guile, and an example configuration file can be generated with `xbindkeys -dg`.

After modifying `~/.xbindkeysrc.scm`, you need to restart the chroot X server (`pkill -SIGHUP xbindkeys` may not always work).

You can debug syntax errors by running:

`METHOD='x11' xbindkeys -fg /etc/crouton/xbindkeysrc.scm -v`,

replacing `x11` by `xephyr` if you are using Xephyr (ARM or explicit choice)
 
### Map Alt+Click to middle button

Getting a middle click is tricky, especially on the Samsung ARM Chromebook: it requires quite a bit of skill to get 3 fingers down on the trackpad at the same time, and sometimes a right click is generated instead.

If your window manager or applications do not require Alt+Click for any other purpose, you can map it to generate a middle button click:

```
; Add to ~/.xbindkeysrc.scm
; Map Alt+click to middle button
; Map on Release so that it does not appear both buttons are pressed
(xbindkey '(release alt "b:1") "xdotool click --clearmodifiers 2")
```

Make sure `xdotool` is installed in your chroot (e.g. by running `sudo apt-get install xdotool`).

See [this post](https://github.com/AurelienLourot/crouton-articles/blob/master/crouton-emacs-middle-click.md) to make it work in emacs.

### Put middle button in bottom left corner of pad

"synclient" shows the current trackpad settings. At the bottom will be something like:

```
    RightButtonAreaLeft     = 1603
    RightButtonAreaRight    = 0
    RightButtonAreaTop      = 1508
    RightButtonAreaBottom   = 0
    MiddleButtonAreaLeft    = 0
    MiddleButtonAreaRight   = 0
    MiddleButtonAreaTop     = 0
    MiddleButtonAreaBottom  = 0
```
That is set, at least for xfce4, by /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-synaptics.conf, by a line in Section "InputClass," which presents those same values in order:
```
Option "SoftButtonAreas" "50% 0 82% 0 0 0 0 0"
```
In this case it's setting the right half of the bottom strip of the pad to be the right button. To add the middle button to the far left front corner, this can work:
```
Option "SoftButtonAreas" "50% 0 82% 0 0 200 1508 0"
```
Percentages or numbers can be used. The full measure of the pad can be got from the top of the synclient output. In the example here, the "1508" is taken from synclient's report of RightButtonAreaTop, the "200" is an arbitrarily small area of the left front corner. Restart the chroot and this will be in effect. To make it fully permanent across system upgrades see the recommendation at the top of the 50-synaptics.conf file on copying to /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/.

### Make Modifier Keys act as alternative keys when pressed on their own.

[xcape](https://github.com/alols/xcape) is a way to remap modifier keys so that they can be used as separate keys on their own, meaning you can press Search on it's own and get Escape (useful in Vim).
You might remap the Alt keys to work as PageUp and PageDown on their own, for example. from [kodi.tv](kodi.tv)
>Kodi (formerly XBMC) is a free and open source media player application developed by the XBMC/Kodi Foundation, a non-profit technology consortium. Kodi is available for multiple operating-systems and hardware platforms, featuring a 10-foot user interface for use with televisions and remote controls. It allows users to play and view most videos, music, podcasts, and other digital media files from local and network storage media and the internet.

Kodi is a target that can be installed with `-t kodi`.

### Features/Notes:
- Works best with modern Ubuntu (~16.04)
- can play h.264 & h.265 out of the box (tested with Acer C720 peppy & Toshiba Chromebook 2 swanky)
- smb/samba works out of the box. cannot scan, must enter port with hostname (445). **([Patch #3503](https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton/pull/3503) in review to fix!)**
- volume is separate from ChromeOS. (make sure it's turned up in chromeos)
- DOES NOT work with kiwi/extension
- ChromeOS power management is disabled while kodi is running, this will prevent it from dimming the monitor or suspending while using kodi.  However, this also means if kodi is running in the background, power management will be disabled as well.
- Samsung XE303C12 Chromebook needs t have kodi installed as below, then xserver has to be installed from chroot, then
  xorg and xiwi need to be installed as an update to kodi, then kodi shold be runnable.
 
## My personal recommendation
I recommend making separate from other targets. `sudo sh ~/Downloads/crouton -t kodi -n kodi`

## Tested With: (feel free to add your model)
- Acer C720 (peppy)
- Samsung XE303C12 Chromebook (Daisy) Does not work at all, see below for instructions to make Kodi work with
                                      Samsung XE303c12 Chromebook).
- Toshiba Chromebook 2 (swanky)

## Instructions for setting up on Samsung Chromebook XEC303C12.

- Use `sudo install -Dt /usr/local/bin -m 755 ~/Downloads/crouton`
- Use `sudo crouton -t kodi -n kodi` like before
- Use `sudo enter-chroot`
- Use `sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-core xserver-xorg-video-dummy xdiagnose`
- then use `exit`
- use `sudo crouton -t kodi,xorg,xiwi -n kodi u` (this will update kodi).
- use `sudo startkodi` (should work, not yet tested).

## TODO
- Fluff out info regarding Kodi uses
- Detail recommended settings# Switch languages in crouton (Debian and Ubuntu)
## Before you begin
You will need to find your locale (see examples below). On Debian/Ubuntu, you can find a list of these in `/usr/share/i18n/SUPPORTED`.

Examples: English is `en` and the United States is `US`. The locale will be `en_US.UTF-8`. The encoding is UTF-8, which should be okay for most people.

British English: `en_GB.UTF-8`

Japanese: `ja_JP.UTF-8`

Canadian French: `fr_CA.UTF-8`

Simplified Chinese: `zh_CN.UTF-8`

Todo after changes:
**You must restart crouton for changes to take effect!**

## Debian
``` 
sudo apt-get install locales keyboard-configuration
```
After, change locales, with rights admin:

```
 dpkg-reconfigure locales
 dpkg-reconfigure console-data
 dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration
```
And, restart the keyboard service:
```
 service keyboard-setup restart
```
Now, you set the graphic session X:

```
setxkbmap de # for deutsch
setxkbmap en # for english
setxkbmap fr # for french
```

Please, read officials documentations about locales, and [Debian Keyboard Configuration](https://wiki.debian.org/Keyboard), for more informations ... 

## Ubuntu

Ubuntu use meta-package...

### Install language packages

Replace {language-code} with the language code from above (`ja` for Japanese, `fr` for French, etc.)
Replace {locale} with your locale (`ja_JP.UTF-8`, `fr_CA.UTF-8`)

### Base language pack (everyone)
```
sudo apt-get install language-pack-{language-code}
```
Example: (French) `sudo apt-get install language-pack-fr`
### GNOME language pack (GNOME shell, Cinnamon, and Unity)
```
sudo apt-get install language-pack-gnome-{language-code}
```
### KDE language pack (KDE)
```
sudo apt-get install language-pack-kde-{language-code}
```
### Libreoffice
`sudo apt-get install libreoffice-l10n-{language-code}`

## Change the default language
```
sudo update-locale LANG="{locale}" LANGUAGE="{language-code}:en"
```
Example: (Japanese) `sudo update-locale LANG="ja_JP.UTF-8" LANGUAGE="ja:en"`

**You must restart crouton for changes to take effect!**

## But I want a GUI!
If you're on Ubuntu, there's a convenient GUI for you! Install `language-selector-gnome` or `language-selector-kde`, and run the "Language Support" application. From there, you can install support for any languages you want, and set preferences for language and regional preferences.##Download Crouton

Download Crouton in the usual way.

##Install Ubuntu 14.04 with X11

In order to get the latest version of Awesome WM working you must use Ubuntu 14.04 LTS with X11 support. To install this:

Press
 
    CTRL-ALT-T

Type

    shell
    sudo sh ~/Downloads/crouton -r trusty -t x11

Allow the installation to finish, add your username and password for Ubuntu.

##Configure Locale/Language

Then you need to configure your language and locale in order for the Copycat-Killers Awesome WM themes to work. I'm UK based so the commands I issue are:

    sudo enter-chroot
    sudo apt-get install language-pack-en
    sudo update-locale LANG="en_GB.UTF-8" LANGUAGE="en:en"

Refer to this page for more instructions on configuring languages:

https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton/wiki/Languages

##Install required packages

Next we need to add a few packages required by Awesome WM and copycat-killers themes:

    sudo apt-get install unclutter nitrogen rxvt-unicode-256color fonts-inconsolata software-properties-common curl imagemagick

##Configure rxvt (not strictly necessary)

Next configure rxvt (a new terminal app) - you do this by adding a .Xdefaults file into your home dir. I've included mine below for reference - it's used with the inconsolata font, font-size 18px (1080p screen - try 11-14 on a 1366x768) with the solarized dark colour scheme:
 
    urxvt*font: xft:Inconsolata:pixelsize=18
    URxvt*scrollBar: false
    URxvt.saveLines: 32767
    URxvt*termName: rxvt

There are a couple of ways to add the .Xdefaults file - the easiest is to add the Text text editor to Chrome OS, copy and paste the above code into the text edit and save it as .Xdefaults in the Downloads folder. Then from inside the shell do this:

    cp ~/Downloads/.Xdefaults ~/.Xdefaults

##Add the latest version of Awesome WM to apt

Now we need to add a PPA for the most recent version of Awesome WM and update our apt:

    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:klaus-vormweg/awesome
    sudo apt-get update

##Install Awesome WM

Now we can install the latest version of Awesome (currently 3.5.6)

    sudo apt-get install awesome

Check our Awesome version:

    awesome -v

This should say awesome v3.5.6 (For Those About To Rock) - if it does then we've been successful!

Now we just need to add a few extras and pick a Copycat-Killers Awesome theme. First do this:

    echo "exec awesome" > ~/.xinitrc

##Install a Copycat-Killers theme

Now lets install our awesome theme. Do the following:

    sudo apt-get install git

Then do this:

    cd ~/
    git clone https://github.com/copycat-killer/awesome-copycats.git

Take a look at https://github.com/copycat-killer/awesome-copycats to pick your favourite theme.

Copy the contents of awesome-copycats into ~/.config/awesome

To do this:

    mkdir ~/.config/awesome
    cp -r ~/awesome-copycats ~/.config/awesome

Then activate your favourite awesome copycat theme:

    cp ~/.config/awesome/rc.lua.copland ~/.config/awesome/rc.lua

Note: Change copland to whatever your favourite theme is. 

##Start up Ubuntu with Awesome WM

You should be ready to fire up Awesome WM! Type exit to leave the chroot then:

    sudo enter-chroot xinit

And check if its all worked!

Press Search + Enter to bring up a terminal and start installing anything and everything you'd like. I went for Chrome, Sublime Text 3, Thunderbird and Skype. Makes for a cheap and amazing full stack developer IDE once you start customising it to your needs.

All credit should go to Isaac Pei for his original guide on installing Awesome in Crouton.

##Optional/Useful Extras

Here are some useful extra commands which can be run from terminal each time you start or added to a startup script:

    setxkbmap gb (changes the default keyboard layout to British)
    synclient VertScrollDelta=-111 (changes scroll direction to Australian scrolling)
    syndaemon -i 0.25 -K -d (prevents use of the trackpad for a quarter of a second after you stop typing)

You can also add in functionality like a delete key option using xkeybinds and xvkbd. 

To do this, install the following:

    sudo apt-get install xvkbd

Then create a .xkeybinds file in your home dir and put this inside it:

    #Delete
    "xvkbd -xsendevent -text '\[Delete]'"
    m:0x40 + c:22
    Mod4 + BackSpace
    
    #
    # End of xbindkeys configuration

This turns Search+Backspace into a delete key.

Once you've saved your .xkeybinds - run this command:

    xkeybinds  I installed vanilla Ubuntu, and added latest Thunderbird,
but did not find way to make it default mail client

it is very irritating when once one has in error clicked on a mail link in browser,
and kmail is not installed, it seems not to be possible to close,
and one is stuck with endless bouncing ball.

[#354151](http://kde-bugs-dist.kde.narkive.com/UN32U9Lr/frameworks-kio-bug-354151-new-kmailservice5-restart-repeatly-when-no-mail-client-is-installed) New: kmailservice5 restart repeatly when no mail client is installed**source of information:** https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/packages/power_manager

**powerd:** user-space daemon running as the "power" user that initiates dimming the screen, suspending the system, etc.

**how it works:** powerd's default preferences are stored on the _read-only_ partition in `/usr/share/power_manager`. These preferences _can be overridden_ by identically-named files on the stateful partition in `/var/lib/power_manager`. In most cases, preference changes won't take effect until the powerd process is restarted.

A script to shorten the screen timeout is already pre installed at `/usr/bin/set_short_powerd_timeouts`. Open it up to see how it's done, or see it in action by executing it with `sudo set_short_powerd_timeouts`. (add `--reset` to undo)

Example to change the 'lid close action' to do nothing, open a crosh shell and follow these commands:
```
sudo -u power cp /usr/share/power_manager/use_lid /var/lib/power_manager       #copy default config
sudo su                                                                        #cant sudo next command
echo 0 >/var/lib/power_manager/use_lid                                         #change the action to do nothing
restart powerd                                                                 #let the change take effect
exit                                                                           #exit root 
```


To disable idle suspend, open a crosh shell and follow these commands:
```
sudo su                                                                        #cant sudo next command
echo 1 >/var/lib/power_manager/disable_idle_suspend                            #change the action to do nothing
chown power:power /var/lib/power_manager/disable_idle_suspend                  #it belongs to power
restart powerd                                                                 #let the change take effect
exit                                                                           #exit root 
```


A wrapper script to disable lid and idle suspend while your chroot is active:
```
#!/bin/sh -e

ROOTUID="0"

if [ "$(id -u)" -ne "$ROOTUID" ] ; then
  echo "This script must be executed with root privileges."
  exit 1
else
  echo 1 >/var/lib/power_manager/disable_idle_suspend
  echo 0 >/var/lib/power_manager/use_lid
  ( (status powerd | fgrep -q "start/running" ) && restart powerd ) || \
  start powerd
  echo "Disabled idle/lid suspend"
  
  #change this with the command you start your chroot with
  startunity $@ || true # ignore any failures here so fix executes

  rm -f /var/lib/power_manager/disable_idle_suspend
  rm -f /var/lib/power_manager/use_lid
  ( (status powerd | fgrep -q "start/running" ) && restart powerd ) || \
  start powerd
  echo "Enabled idle/lid suspend"
fi
```## Printing from Crouton

You want to print from your crouton? 

1. Install cups and related packages:
`sudo apt-get install cups system-config-printer-gnome`
<br/>To get a working `lpr` command, also install `cups-bsd`. You'll also want to install `hplip` if you're using an HP printer. Get the latest hplip package and make from [http://hplipopensource.com/](http://hplipopensource.com/). There maybe other packages necessary for other printers, please add them here.
<br/>If you want only browser-based cups admin, leave out `system-config-printer-gnome`.

2. Add yourself to the lpadmin group:
`sudo adduser <username> lpadmin`

3. init scripts don't work right in crouton so we need to start cups somehow. One way is to edit `/etc/rc.local` and add:
`/usr/sbin/cupsd`

4. If you want to connect to remote CUPS servers, install `cups-browsed`, put your configuration into `/etc/cups/cups-browsed.conf`, and in `/etc/rc.local` add:
`/usr/sbin/cups-browsed &`

5. Log out of your crouton and back in. 

6. Add or configure printers using either system-config-printer-gnome, or using the CUPS web interface -- open a browser window and type [http://localhost:631](http://localhost:631). When managing printer, if you can't get pass the authentication, check that you have add the user to lpadmin group as described previously, and check that only one /usr/sbin/cupsd is running at the same time.  

_This has been tested on a shared network printer.  It also works for directly connected printers, including an ML-1740._


***


Samsung ARM Chromebook and HP printers requiring proprietary plugin, e.g. HP p1102w

The proprietary plugin from HP for certain printers is a binary file downloaded as part of the hplip installation process. The source code is not available and the binary will not run on ARM processors. This is a known limitation and is well documented at [https://bugs.launchpad.net/hplip/+bug/1152219](https://bugs.launchpad.net/hplip/+bug/1152219)

** UPDATE ** Plugin files for ARM are now supported in hplip 3.15.4

** Changed in: hplip
       Status: In Progress => Fix Released

An alternative printer driver is available from [http://foo2zjs.rkkda.com/](http://foo2zjs.rkkda.com/)

## Printing from Chrome OS

The instruction above allows you to print from your crouton. But what if you want to print from your Chrome OS? By default Chrome OS allows printing only through Google Cloud Print, which is fine if you have a Google Cloud Print compatible printers, or a Windows or Mac machine to host the classic (non Google Cloud compatible) printers. Chance are if you reach this page, you don't. 

If you have HP printers try installing [HP Print for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hp-print-for-chrome/cjanmonomjogheabiocdamfpknlpdehm?hl=en-US) which should allows you to print to classic HP printers.  

### CUPS printer connector for Chrome/Chromebooks

If you have already set up CUPS in your chroot as per the instructions above or have a CUPS print server on the local network you can try the [CUPS / IPP extension for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ipp-cups-printing-for-chr/lkhfeoafdgbaecajkdbioenncjopbpmk) which allows you to print to multiple CUPS connected printers without going through Cloud Print. The CUPS/IPP print option option will appear in the printer list of Chrome(OS). Remember to configure the extension with your full printer URI: something like https://localhost:631/printers/my_printer - check the CUPS extension help section for details.

### Connecting classic printers to Google Cloud Print

If you have some other brands or the above extension didn't work, here are two other ways you can print from Chrome to classic printers:

1. [Google CUPS connector](https://github.com/google/cups-connector). The official way provided by Google to link Google Cloud Print account to CUPS. That way, all your local printers listed in CUPS will be made available in your Google Cloud Print and you can select those printers when printing through Chrome. 
2. Python [cloudprint](https://github.com/armooo/cloudprint). Unofficial script that allows you get the same result, easier to setup, less advanced functionalities (e.g. can't automatically share the printers to other google accounts -- relevant in organizations).

Note that both assumed you already setup printer(s) in CUPS at localhost on previous instructions and can successfully do a print job, and set CUPS to run automatically in `/etc/rc.local`. If you haven't done this please go back to the beginning of this page and run them through. 

### Google CUPS connector

Follow the installation setup at https://github.com/google/cups-connector, or here is a tested instruction for ARM-based Chromebooks (tried in trusty) that you can follow fairly quickly.

Compile Go v1.4+. Google CUPS connector was written in Go and requires at least Go v1.4. Ubuntu repository only has binary up to v1.2, so you need to compile Go 1.4:

    sudo apt-get install git curl binutils bison gcc make
    bash < <(curl -s -S -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moovweb/gvm/master/binscripts/gvm-installer)
    source /home/$USER/.gvm/scripts/gvm
    gvm install go1.4
    gvm use go1.4 --default

Compile Google CUPS Connector codes

    sudo apt-get install build-essential libcups2-dev libsnmp-dev
    go get github.com/google/cups-connector/connector
    go get github.com/google/cups-connector/connector-init
    go get github.com/google/cups-connector/connector-monitor
    go get github.com/google/cups-connector/connector-util

Generate configuration file
    
    cd ~
    connector-init -retain-user-oauth-token="false" -socket-filename="/tmp/cups-connector-monitor.sock" -proxy-name="Crouton-Proxy-1"

Open the URL on chrome and press accept to give Google CUPS Connector access to your Google Cloud Print account. Copy the resulting code, paste to crouton shell, then press enter.

Test the service

    connector

Open https://www.google.com/cloudprint#printers check that your CUPS printer(s) are listed. Done!

To run the Google Cloud Connector again in the future, enter-chroot and run `connector` from your home directory.

### Python cloudprint

Install [cloudprint](https://github.com/armooo/cloudprint)

    sudo apt-get install python-pip python-dev
    sudo pip install cloudprint[daemon]

If your Python is less than v2.7.9 (most likely), update the SSL library:

    sudo apt-get install libffi-dev libssl-dev
    sudo pip install pyopenssl ndg-httpsclient pyasn1

Generate configuration file

    cloudprint

Open the short URL on Chrome and press Finish printer registration, click manage printer, check that your printer(s) are listed. Done!

To run the cloudprint again in the future, enter-chroot and run `cloudprint -d` from your home directory.

The _**SME Storage Made Easy**_ product is a very handy thing when loaded in a chroot.

You get a free Amazon S3 (5GB) account from SMES when signing up for the free Personal account and up to 3 more other Cloud Providers can be linked in, also with the free Personal account.
For the Cloud Providers, there are several Google products (Google Drive, Google Docs, Gmail, etc.), Amazon S3, Dropbox, Box.net, CloudMe, Office 365, SkyDrive, etc.

There's even a _**Chrome Web App**_ that has a very robust set of features - it's not just a hyper-link.
The link is here -

  **'[Storage Made Easy Cloud Dashboard Pro](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/storage-made-easy-cloud-d/fifbddboijfpcjflfocelaelpbefjbha)'**

~~If you're looking for a quick & easy guide, it's already been done at the _**'Ubuntu in The Wild'**_ site here -~~

  ~~**'[Merge cloud storage on Ubuntu using SME](http://ubuntuinthewild.blogspot.com/2012/05/merge-cloud-storage-on-ubuntu-using-sme.html)'**~~

**Sorry, the '*Ubuntu in The Wild*' aritcle/site has been taken down apparently.**

If you'd like a little more guidance, just read on...

***

### _STEP-BY-STEP INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS_:

_Part 1 - In the Browser_

* Goto the StorageMadeEasy site - http://storagemadeeasy.com/

* Scroll down near the bottom of the page and click on the link that says: _'Click here for Personal Cloud and Sync solutions'_.

![Personal Cloud and Sync solutions](smes-images/1a.png)

*  Scroll down to the middle of the page that shows _'Cloud Apps for your Desktop'_ and click on the link that says: 'Linux Cloud Drive'

* Once you're on this page you can read about all the features and benifits of SMEStorage and decide if it's something you need or want. If so, then scroll down to the middle of the page and click on the _'Download'_ link for your distribution, most likely Ubuntu or Debian - it's actually the same [.deb](https://storagemadeeasy.com/files/a1ab4ef2bc8a4323d2e186cfdfa4a779.deb) file. Make sure it's saved in the ~/Downloads folder so you can access it from your chroot later.

![Download *nix tools](smes-images/2.png)

* At this point, you can register for a free SMES account by scrolling back up to the top of the page and clicking on the link that says: 'Register', just to the left of 'Sign In' which you'll use later. In the area that shows 'FREE Cloud Packages' you click on the 'Sign Up' button under +3 clouds, it's not highlighted until you hover over it.

![Registration / Sign-up](smes-images/1b.png)

* Complete the User Registration form after double-ckecking that the Selected package is the Free one.

![Registration form](smes-images/3.png)

* Once submitted, you should receive an email message with a link to activate your account. After this, you should get a 2nd email message showing your login name and telling you what to do next with some helpful links. ( You might want to save this 2nd email message because it has a 'reset password' link that you can use if you forget your password. ) They recommend you at least read a wiki page about 'The top 5 things to understand about SMEStorage' here - https://storagemadeeasy.com/wiki/top5things/

* Now it's time to go back to http://storagemadeeasy.com/, sign-in and setup your 'Cloud Providers'. You can do most things from your 'Dashboard' like add providers, change your settings for Sync, File versioning and more.

![Dashboard in browser](smes-images/4.png)

_Part 2 - In the Shell_

* Once you have setup your Cloud Providers, you can drop to a Cros shell and then enter your chroot via your favorite installed Desktop Environment (I.E.) _``'sudo startxfce -n (chrootname)'``. Now in your chroot Desktop, open the Downloads folder in your file browser and select the 'storagemadeeasy_4.0.5.deb' file (or a later version), it should then open up in the Software Center if you have it installed or perhaps Gdebi - if no gui installer opens, you can drop to a shell and type ``'sudo dpkg -i ~/Downloads/storagemadeeasy_4.0.5.deb'``_ to install it from a command line. Now you can use the gui tools, namely 'SME Client', 'SME Explorer', and 'SME Sync' to access your SMES cloud storage.  
**NOTE**: Some individuals have reported problems with dependencies when attempting to install this package and a good tip from [the master](https://github.com/dnschneid) is provided in [this link](https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton/issues/312#issuecomment-24287882). 

![Ubuntu Software Center](smes-images/5.png)

* You can also 'mount' or 'unmount' your SMEStorage folders and access them from a shell command line or a file browser via the script 'sme.mount' available _[here](https://gist.github.com/DennisLfromGA/8105549#file-sme-mount)_. If you want to use the script, either edit it to put in your own credentials and SMEStorage folder location or enter them on the command line - _``'sme.mount Folder_Location Username Password'`` - enter ``'sme.mount -h'``_ for usage. You can copy the 'sme.mount' script to your Downloads folder and use it in both the chroot and Cros shell, respectively -

  _``sh -e ~/Downloads/sme.mount [SMES_Folder_Loc] [SMES_Username] [SMES_Password]``_## _... via crouton ..._

**UPDATE**: This is no longer viable with every device on [freon](https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton/issues/1567#issuecomment-88235073) now ( and no `host-x11`) so it's dead Jim...

# Setting up cron jobs under crouton

As per [ticket 957](https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton/issues/957):

> crouton doesn't use upstart, so you need to run crond explicitly, probably from the chroot's /etc/rc.local. Look inside /etc/init/cron for the commands needed to launch crond.

So edit `/etc/rc.local` and add the following line **before** `exit 0`:

    exec cron

This will start the `cron` process as **root** for the system. Being the case, any cron jobs added at the user level *will not work* (ie anything added using the command `crontab -e`). For this reason you will have to add crons to the `/etc/crontab` file.# Sharing files and folders between ChromeOS and your chroot

The `/etc/crouton/shares` file in your chroot defines directories to map into the chroot from the host.<br>
Order is important: be sure to mount directories before you mount subdirectories of those mounts.

*Outside* the chroot, the only directories that can be mapped are
subdirectories of the following locations:

* downloads: ~/Downloads

  Anything in this folder is encrypted by ChromeOS using the logged in user profile, such that only that user may access it. ChromeOS may delete files from here if space gets low.

* shared:    /mnt/stateful_partition/crouton/shared

  Like chroots themselves, the contents of this directory can be accessed by anybody, without logging in.

* encrypted: ~/crouton/shared

  Like `downloads`, this folder is encrypted by ChromeOS. However, ChromeOS will not delete the contents of this directory.

These directories are all managed by ChromeOS, not the chroot. That means they will not be included in chroot backups.

*Inside* the chroot, any absolute or user-relative path (~/x or ~user/x) is OK. **Using a path that already exists in the chroot will result in that path being overmounted and difficult to access.**

Syntax is as follows:

 `HOSTDIR CHROOTDIR [OPTIONS]`

Directory names can have spaces (if quoted), but no quote characters or relative path elements (..'s).<br>
Options can be any fstab-like options to mount. If unspecified, "exec" is assumed.

## Examples:
 Share a home directory encrypted by the current user's unsynced profile

 `encrypted/home ~`

 Share an unencrypted directory between chroots.

 `shared/home ~/Share`

 Absolute directories on the chroot side work too

 `shared/bin /usr/local/bin exec,suid`

 Share a noexec path that has spaces, and a specific user home directory

 `"encrypted/stupid example" "~omg/Why are you even doing this?" noexec`

## Expose the whole chroot to chromeos

> WARNING: dont delete things unless you want to delete them.

Most chrome-apps don't allow access to the home-folder (only USB and Downloads-folder)
The simplest workaround is:

1. buy a tiny usb stick and plug it into your chromebook:
2. create an empty directory on it, called 'crouton'
3. then enter your crouton chroot, and run this command:

```
mount --bind / /media/removable/YOURUSBDISK/crouton
```

Now all chroot-folders are accessible by chromeos using the USB-folder

> *TODO* automation using fstab  Although shutting down ChromeOS with an active chroot may work, it isn't recommended. Chroots on SD cards are particularly susceptible to corruption.

To cleanly umount the chroot, first logoff/exit any graphical environment you are running (how to do this depends on the graphical environment, although switching back to the Crouton tab and hitting <kbd>CTRL-C</kbd> should normally work if your chroot is running in the foreground), then type `exit`. You should see something like this.

    Unmounting /mnt/stateful_partition/crouton/chroots/jessie...
    Sending SIGTERM to processes under /mnt/stateful_partition/crouton/chroots/jessie...
    chronos@localhost /usr/local/bin $ 

It is safe to shut down ChromeOS at this point.# Ubuntu

## End of Life releases:

crouton nominally doesn't support EOL releases of distros, but feel free to [file a bug](https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton/issues/new) and we'll try to fix things that break.

| Release name | Release # | End-Of-Life date |
| --- | --- | :--- |
| **`precise`** | **12.04 LTS** | **_reached EOL on 28 April 2017_**
| `quantal`  | 12.10 | reached EOL on 16 May 2014
| `raring`  | 13.04 | reached EOL on 27 January 2014
| `saucy`  | 13.10 | reached EOL on 17 July 2014
| `utopic`  | 14.10 | reached EOL on 23 July 2015
| `vivid`   | 15.04 | reached EOL on 04 February 2016

See the [Ubuntu wiki](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases) for a full list.

##### Since `precise` is now EOL'd and `xenial` is now the default release, please upgrade your `precise` chroot(s) [as shown below](#to-upgrade-to-a-more-recent-version-of-ubuntu) or install a new one with `-r xenial`.

##### And it's *always* wise to [backup your chroot(s)](https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton#a-backup-a-day-keeps-the-price-gouging-data-restoration-services-away) before an upgrade, update or any major change.

## To upgrade to a more recent version of Ubuntu:

You can use this graphical method *in* your chroot:

- __[Ubuntu's update manager](http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/upgrade)__

Or follow these instructions in a crosh shell:  

**1.** `sudo enter-chroot -n <chroot_name>`  
    NOTE: (replace `<chroot_name>` with the name of your chroot, e.g. `precise`)

**2.** `sudo apt-get install update-manager-core python-apt`

**3.** `sudo do-release-upgrade`

--------
After the upgrade, *whether it be by the graphical method or the command line*, **_it is important to make sure that crouton is updated_**:

* `sudo crouton -n <chroot_name>`**`-u`**

By default, the name of a chroot is its release name (e.g. a `precise` chroot's name is `precise`).  
After an upgrade, you end up with a `xenial` chroot, whose name is `precise`.  Confusing? You can easily rename it with:

* `sudo edit-chroot precise -m xenial`

--------
### Upgrade from LTS to non-LTS

LTS releases (e.g. `precise`, 12.04) are supported by Ubuntu for 5 years.  
By default, they will not upgrade to non-LTS release (e.g. `quantal` 12.10).  
If you really want to do that, edit `/etc/update-manager/release-upgrades` and replace `Prompt=lts` by `Prompt=normal`.

# Debian

Following the Debian guide and updating the chroot should work. (untested)This site appears not to be closely monitored. It contains hints and tips, user experiences, etc. We are all learning more about Crouton, specifically, and Linux, in general, everyday. Some of my own articles need to be cleaned up and/or re-written.

Feel free to add your own comments to any article here, without destroying original content. This is really a self-help community.

~JamesThis cool trick is not covered anywhere. Type in these commands from the shell:  
  
    cd /usr/local  
    ls -l  

You will notice a shortcut, or link, to the location of your chroots. Here is what mine looks like:  
  
    chronos@localhost /usr/local $ ls -l  
    total 4  
    drwxr-xr-x. 2 root root 4096 Jul 27 19:52 bin  
    lrwxrwxrwx. 1 root root   50 Jul 29 16:46 chroots -> /media/removable/Storage/sevak/Chromebook/chroots/  
    chronos@localhost /usr/local $   

This is not what yours will look like! I have changed the location where my chroots will be installed to a subfolder of my home directory in a dual-boot install! There are so many cool things I can do with this.

If you have existing chroots, don't try this until you have moved them to the new location. Disclaimer: moving chroots is tricky and can completely screw them up.

Crouton will install your chroots to wherever this shortcut, or link, points. Here is the code:  
  
    cd /usr/local  
    sudo rm chroots  
    sudo ln -s /foo/chroots/ chroots

"foo" is an accepted placeholder for whatever goes in its place. The folder doesn't even have to be named chroots, just the link does. Here is an example using the Downloads folder:  

    cd /usr/local  
    sudo rm chroots  
    sudo ln -s ~/Downloads/MyChroots/ chroots

Happy hacking!!!# Basic concepts
`xiwi` (X11 in a Window) works by creating a window in Chrome and channeling a virtual X11 framebuffer over to it.  While crouton transfers the framebuffer relatively efficiently, there's no GPU acceleration and a fair bit of overhead, so don't expect games or graphics-heavy desktop environments to perform well.  For basic productivity use it works great, though.

Regardless of how you intend to use xiwi (full desktop environment vs. single-app), you need to add it to your chroot.

1. Install the `xiwi` target into your chroot, either via update (`crouton -u -t xiwi`) or via initial install (`crouton -t xiwi,xfce`).  If you only intend to use the single-app mode, you can avoid installing a desktop environment entirely (`-t xiwi`).
2. Ensure you have the [Chromium OS 'crouton integration' extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/crouton-integration/gcpneefbbnfalgjniomfjknbcgkbijom) installed.

If you want to temporarily launch using native Xorg, add the -X parameter to your enter- or start* command (e.g.: `sudo startxfce4 -X xorg`).

You can set the default xmethod back to xorg by updating with the `xorg` target explicitly, after which you can still use xiwi via -X (e.g.: `sudo startxfce4 -X xiwi`).

Hit the full screen (above the 5 key) or switch window (above the 6 key) to get out of full-screen crouton.

If you close the window, xiwi is still running.  You can get back to your windows via the 'crouton integration' extension dropdown.

<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Back/Forward</kbd> still works to cycle chroots, although it makes less sense here since Chromium OS's window management works fine too.

You can have xiwi chroots and xorg choots running simultaneously.  Usually it's not a good idea to run two instances of a desktop environment in the same chroot at the same time, but in most cases it's fine to run multiple xiwi single-application instances even alongside a desktop environment inside the same chroot.

# Running full desktops in a window
Once you have xiwi set up, launching your desktop is the same as if you were using xorg (i.e., `sudo startxfce4`).  

# Running full desktops in a tab
Example: `sudo startxfce4 -n chrootname -X xiwi-tab`
Substitute any graphical desktop start script as desired. You can toggle to full screen and back to tab via F4. You can close the tab via the 'X' on the tab itself and then reopen the tabbed session via the crouton extension pulldown menu. This tip will save you endless hassles of stopping and restarting a chroot from the commandline each time, you can just close it and reopen it from the plugin pulldown as often as necessary. If you logout of the session while in fullscreen, the shell command exits and you have to launch from the crosh prompt again.

# Running individual applications in windows and tabs
With xiwi installed, you do not need a desktop environment.  You can launch apps on an individual basis in a Chromium OS window or tab.

1. Enter your chroot to get a command line: `sudo enter-chroot`
2. Launch your app via the `xiwi` command: `xiwi gimp`
3. Use `xiwi -T gimp` to launch in a tab, or `xiwi -F gimp` to launch full-screen.
4. You can combine those into a single command `sudo enter-chroot xiwi -T gimp`.
5. You can silence output and run the command in the background via `sudo enter-chroot -b xiwi -T gimp`.

If your application forks and quits, xiwi may get confused and quit as well (you'll get an error/quit when the window launches).  Search your application's documentation for a parameter that prevents forking (oftentimes it's `-f`).  If you can't find one, you can pass `-f` to xiwi itself (e.g., `xiwi -f gvim`), and xiwi will not close unless there are no applications visible and you close the Chromium OS window. It's always better to use the appropriate options on the application's side of things if possible, though (`xiwi gvim -f` in this example).

You can pass parameters to your application like normal, but remember that if you use the combined form (e.g., `sudo enter-chroot xiwi gimp`), your current directory is ignored.  So even if you're in your Downloads folder and want to edit img.jpg, `sudo enter-chroot -b xiwi gimp ~/Downloads/img.jpg` is necessary.

Single-window applications work better than multi-window applications, but if you end up with multiple windows, you can switch between them via either the tabs at the top, or via the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd> and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd> keyboard shortcuts.  <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Escape</kbd> acts the same as the close button on most windows.  If a pop-up window appears in a weird place, you can either drag-move it, or <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>'Drag'</kbd> to resize it.

If you launch applications via aliases, the xiwi command will not know about them.  You can add the following snippet to your .bashrc/.zshrc to handle basic aliases:

```
# Wrap xiwi so that aliases work
xiwi() {
    local xiwiargs=''
    while [ "${1#-}" != "$1" ]; do
        xiwiargs="$xiwiargs $1"
        shift
    done
    local cmd="`alias "$1" 2>/dev/null`"
    if [ -z "$cmd" ]; then
        cmd="$1"
    else
        eval "cmd=${cmd#*=}"
        cmd="env $cmd"
    fi
    shift
    eval "/usr/local/bin/xiwi $xiwiargs $cmd \"\$@\""
}
```    # Tested working on crouton as of 2014-08-01
    # run this once in chroot / ubuntu to install and set basic awesome configuration

    sudo apt-get install awesome
    echo "exec awesome" > ~/.xinitrc
    mkdir -p ~/.config/awesome
    cp -r /etc/xdg/awesome/* ~/.config/awesome/
    
    # after installing awesome, then issue the following at crosh to add the alias
    # then in the future, just type: startawesome to start in awesome
    # echo "alias startawesome='sudo enter-chroot xinit'" >> ~/.bashrc



# Using i3 in crouton 

1. Create a chroot with X11:  
`$ sudo sh ~/Downloads/crouton -r trusty -t x11 `
2. Enter the chroot:  
`$ sudo enter-chroot -n trusty`
3. Install i3:  
`$ sudo apt-get install i3`
4. Add `exec i3` to ~/.xinitrc:  
`$ echo "exec i3" > ~/.xinitrc`
5. Launch i3 directly from the crosh shell:  
`$ sudo enter-chroot xinit`
6. Create an alias for starting in i3:  
add `alias starti3='sudo enter-chroot -n trusty xinit'` to your `/home/chronos/user/.bashrc` (chromeos)

### Helpful configurations

* To change themes easily without installing too many other packages try: `sudo apt-get install lxappearance`
* For a proper Delete key, use `bindsym $mod+BackSpace exec xdotool key Delete` in your i3 config

----

# Alternatively: Crouton + XFCE + i3

Install crouton with XFCE and log in into XFCE with `sudo startxfce4`. Download i3: `$ sudo apt-get install i3`

Go to 'Session and Startup > Application Autostart' settings and '+ Add' a new command with the following field values:

- Name: i3
- Description: i3
- Command: /usr/bin/i3

Go to 'Session and Startup > Session', select the 'xfce-desktop' (amongst other xfce desktop related items -- all I have running is `Xfsettingsd`, `Power Manager`, and `pulseaudio`) and click 'Quit program'. Save session and restart chroot.

i3 should be up and running at this point.


# Run i3 within [[xiwi|crouton in a Chromium OS window (xiwi)]] (running in a chrome window, instead of in xorg etc)

## Install i3
If you haven't installed xiwi (or used it), you can follow the page below to install:

  https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton/wiki/crouton-in-a-Chromium-OS-window-%28xiwi%29
  (Note: To install xiwi target, e.g. sudo sh ~/Downloads/crouton.sh -t xiwi ...)
  
Then make sure we have i3 installed (additionally you may need dmenu installed):
  sudo apt-get install i3 dmenu
  (note: actually i3 is already installed with the default xiwi target, but in case not, you can use the command above, follow the instructions above to install. )

## There are 2 methods to run i3 under xiwi:
  1. Run i3 after entering in a crouton prompt:
```
      $ sudo enter-chroot
      $ XMETHOD=xiwi xinit /usr/bin/i3
      (i3 would be happily running within xiwi under crouton)
```
Or, one liner (thanks [@dragon788](https://github.com/dragon788)): 
```
sudo  sh -e "/usr/local/bin/enter-chroot" "$@" exec env XMETHOD=xiwi  xinit /usr/bin/i3
```

  2. Alternatively, create the following script to start i3 (modified based on startxfce4 etc), for which I named as starti3:
    ` 
>       #!/bin/sh -e
>       set -e
>       APPLICATION="${0##*/}"
>       
>       USAGE="$APPLICATION [options]
>       
>       Wraps enter-chroot to start a i3 session.
>       By default, it will log into the primary user on the first chroot found.
>       
>       Options are directly passed to enter-chroot; run enter-chroot to list them."
>       
>       exec sh -e "/usr/local/bin/enter-chroot" "$@" exec xinit /usr/bin/i3
>     `

## Issues with running i3 under xiwi:
  - Currently, mod+1, 2, 3 ... doesn't work to switch workspace. For which I suspect chromebook system intercepts these keys as they are default shortcut key on chromebook ... don't know if there's a fix for it yet.

For example, it can change the permissions of device nodes, to allow access to devices as a normal user.

### Leverage on Chromium OS' udev daemon (recommended)

udev is already running in Chromium OS, and we can use it.  To do so,

* Put files containing (only) the rules you need in `/etc/udev/rules.d` in the chroot.

* In `/etc/rc.local`, add the lines

        mkdir -p /run/udev/rules.d
        cp /etc/udev/rules.d/*.rules /run/udev/rules.d
        udevadm control --reload

(`/run/udev` is bind-mounted to the appropriate Chromium OS directory.)

#### Sample rules

Note that user and group names specified in rules will be matched to the Chromium OS `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/group` files rather than the chroot's.  The chroot's numerical values can be used instead, e.g. `GROUP="1234"` in the example above.

The default rules used by Chromium OS can be found in `/lib/udev/rules.d` (outside the chroot). Using the same filename in `/etc/udev/rules.d` (inside the chroot) will override the rule in `/lib/udev/rules.d`. It is recommended to choose a different name, starting in `999-`, so it gets executed after Chromium OS rules.

##### Security key devices

[Security keys](http://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.com/2014/10/strengthening-2-step-verification-with.html) can be used in the chroot, with Chrome/Chromium release >= 38.

First, figure out your USB vendor/product id from the output of `dmesg`, right after plugging in the device (`lsusb` can also provide this information):

    [...] usb 1-1.2: new full-speed USB device number 45 using ehci_hcd
    [...] usb 1-1.2: New USB device found, idVendor=2581, idProduct=f1d0

In this case, vendor/product ids are `2581` and `f1d0`.

Then create `/etc/udev/rules.d/999-securitykey.rules` with the following content, updating the vendor/product fields as required:

    SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="2581", ATTRS{idProduct}=="f1d0", OWNER="root", GROUP="devbroker-access", MODE="0660"

Finally, add your user to the `devbroker-access` group:

    sudo usermod -G devbroker-access -a $USER

Then restart your chroot.

Do not attempt to use another group, as Chromium OS will change the device group when it is used from Chromium OS, blocking its use from crouton.

##### Other devices

See udev documentation (e.g. http://reactivated.net/writing_udev_rules.html) for more information.

### Running a second udev daemon in the chroot

The udev daemon can be run inside a crouton chroot by including `/etc/init.d/udev start` in `/etc/rc.local`.  However, this can cause conflicts, e.g. the default udev rules make crouton's audio fail.  This is not advised.
