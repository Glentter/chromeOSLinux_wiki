This project may not be worth your time, but here goes. Open up xscreensaver, and just go down the list. Click Preview on each one. Some screensavers will crash your chroot almost instantly, and you will have to get back to ChromeOS. Try this:

1. Shift-Ctrl-Alt-F1 (left arrow)
2. Ctrl-Alt-F2 (right arrow)
3. Ctrl-Alt-F1 (left arrow)

Now restart your chroot, if possible. If not, you may have to reboot. Anyhow, go back into your xscreensaver and uncheck the activation box for the "bad" hack.

Generally, make sure no box is checked for any screensaver hack which is not installed. If the item fails to show a preview, uncheck it. VidWhacker is a good example. I've had success with installing xscreensaver-data-extra, then going down the entire list, making sure everything is congruent.

It may be easier to choose just a single screensaver, or blank screen, or disable xscreensaver, or uninstall it.
