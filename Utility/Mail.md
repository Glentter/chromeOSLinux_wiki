I installed vanilla Ubuntu, and added latest Thunderbird,
but did not find way to make it default mail client

it is very irritating when once one has in error clicked on a mail link in browser,
and kmail is not installed, it seems not to be possible to close,
and one is stuck with endless bouncing ball.
